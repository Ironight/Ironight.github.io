                    The origin of when the pyramids of Giza were built can be traced back for millennia, all the way back to king Khufu during Ancient Egypt. 
                    The first pyramids of Ancient Egypt were built around 2550 BC for the death of Sneferu (Khufu's father), who died in 2551 BC. 
                    To learn more about how the pyramids and its impact in society, you can go to the culture or traditions sections.

                        The Pyramids of Giza were one of the tallest structures in the world for more than four millennia, with a height of 146.6 meter and a base of 138.5 meter. 
                        But that title was passed by the Lincoln Cathedral in the 1300s, which is located in England.

                        Inside of each pyramid, there is a tomb in the center where the royal pharaohs lay buried, but also a tomb for the queen underneath the tomb. 
                        Currently there are a total of 118 tombs, but still counting today.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The location of the pyramids of Giza lay in the west bank of the Nile river in northern Egypt, near the capital Cairo. 
                        Where there are several ways to get to the pyramids, a few recommendations are: with a taxi, an Uber, a tour guide or with a private guide and driver. 
                        Once you have arrived at the pyramids there are several things to do like camel ride, visit The Valley Temple of Khafre or see the solar boat to experience life as it was.
